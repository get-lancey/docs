## Overview

Buttertable enables developers to define their AI workflows once and scale them to handle any workload size. With built-in safety and resilience, you can run these workflows across multiple LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others.

Each workflow consists of three core components:

- **Table**: The container for your workflow data
- **Columns**: Define the output structure, prompt, and the LLM model to use
- **Rows**: The actual data that flows through your workflow

Buttertable ensures your AI workflows are:

- **Scalable**: Run your workflows on workloads of any size
- **Safe**: Built-in retry mechanisms and automatic recovery from failures
- **Durable**: Rules are clearly defined and consistently applied
- **Distributed**: Scale your workflows across multiple instances
- **Provider-agnostic**: Switch between different LLM providers seamlessly
- **Structured**: Get consistent, well-formatted outputs for your applications

In this quickstart, you will learn:

- How to create a new **table**
- How to define **columns** for structured output
- How to add data **rows** to your table
- How to receive results by setting up **webhooks**

This guide will walk you through building a simple AI workflow that can be expanded to handle more complex use cases as you become familiar with Buttertable's capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Account for [platform](https://platform.buttertable.com)

## Account setup

Before you can build AI workflows with Buttertable, you'll need to set up your account and obtain an Admin key to authenticate your requests.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Buttertable platform">
    Go to [platform](https://platform.buttertable.com) and log in to your
    account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up model provider">
    Once logged in, then select **"Models"** in the sidebar under the
    **Workspace** section. Setup one of the model providers by pasting an api
    key from the provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get buttertable Admin key">
    Then select **"Admin keys"** in the sidebar under the **Workspace** section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate a new Admin key">
    Click on the "Create" button. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g.,
    "Quickstart"). Copy and securely store your new Admin key - you'll need it
    to authenticate your requests to the Buttertable API/SDK.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Installing the SDK

Buttertable can be installed using your preferred package manager. The package provides a fully-typed SDK for interacting with the Buttertable API.

<Note>
  Make sure you have Node.js/bun installed (version 18 or higher recommended)
  before installing @buttertable/js.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @buttertable/js
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @buttertable/js
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @buttertable/js
```

```bash bun
bun add @buttertable/js
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  We recommend using TypeScript for the best development experience with
  @buttertable/js, as it provides type safety and better IDE integration.
</Tip>

## Your first workflow

Now that you have your Admin key, you can start setting up your workflow. Let's create a simple example that demonstrates how to use Buttertable.

<Warning>
  Always use your Admin key in a secure backend environment and never expose it
  in client-side code for security reasons.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize the Buttertable client">
    First, initialize the Buttertable client with your Admin key.

   <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript bun
    import { createButterTable } from "@buttertable/js/bun";

    const bt = await createButterTable("<ADMIN_KEY>");

    const project = await bt.projects.create({
      name: "quickstart",
      uid: "quickstart",
    });

    ```
    ```typescript node
    import { createButterTable } from "@buttertable/js/node";

    const bt = await createButterTable("<ADMIN_KEY>");

    const project = await bt.projects.create({
      name: "quickstart",
      uid: "quickstart",
    });

    ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new table">
    Next, create a table that will contain your workflow data.

    ```typescript
    const table = await project.tables.create({
      name: "poem workflow",
      description:
        "A workflow for creating a poem and then classifying it as a cat or a dog poem",
      uid: "poem-workflow",
    });
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Define columns for structured output">
    Define the columns that will structure your workflow outputs.

    ```typescript

    // generate a poem column
    const poemColumn = await table.columns.create({
      name: "poem",
      uid: "poem",
      definition: {
        type: "ai",
        model: "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
        prompt:
          "Write a poem about a cat or a dog named [[data]]. Make it short and sweet.", // [[data]] is a variable that will be replaced with the data from the row
        output: {
          type: "text",
          multiple: false,
        },
      },
    });

    // classify the poem into which animal it is about
    const animalMentionedColumn = await table.columns.create({
      name: "Animal mentioned",
      uid: "animal-mentioned",
      definition: {
        type: "ai",
        model: "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
        prompt: "Which animal is the {{poem}} about?", // {{poem}} references uid of the poem column
        output: {
          type: "classification",
          multiple: false,
          choices: ["dog", "cat"],
        },
      },
    });
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add data rows to your table">
    Now, add some data rows that will be processed by your workflow.

    ```typescript
    // Add rows to your table
    const row = await table.rows.create({
      uid: "1",
      value: "Oatmeal",
    });
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Retrieve the results">
    Finally, retrieve the results manually.

    ```typescript
    // we might have a wait for a few seconds for the AI to generate the poem
    const cells = await row.cells({
      columns: ["poem", "animal-mentioned"],
    });

    for (const cell of cells) {
      console.log(cell.data);
    }
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

With these steps, you've created a complete workflow that:

1. Creates a table with a poem column
2. Generates a poem about a name using AI
3. Classifies which animal the poem is about
4. Retrieves the generated content

You can now run this code to set up your workflow, and Buttertable will handle the scaling and reliability of the workflow.
