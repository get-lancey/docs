butter lets you define multi-step AI workflows—like parsing, enrichment, and classification—and run them at scale, with built-in retries, versioning, and control.

## Key features

- **Scalable:** Run your workflows on workloads of any size
- **Safe:** Built-in retry mechanisms and automatic recovery from failures
- **Durable:** Rules are clearly defined and consistently applied with automatic retries for failed steps
- **Distributed:** Scale your workflows across multiple instances
- **Provider-agnostic:** Switch between different LLM providers seamlessly
- **Structured:** Get consistent, well-formatted outputs for your applications
- **Managed Dependencies:** Don't worry about writing code to manage which data references need to run first
- **Monitoring included:** Track your workflows and logs without additional setup

## What is durable execution?

Durable execution means your workflow can run reliably over time even if parts of it fail, restart, or get interrupted. Each step is tracked, retried if needed, and its state is saved so you don't lose progress.

In practice, this means:

- If a step fails, it can automatically retry or fall back without restarting the whole workflow
- If your server restarts or crashes, the workflow picks up where it left off
- You can see exactly what ran, what succeeded, what failed, and why

This lets you run long-running, multi-step AI workflows (like document parsing or RAG) with confidence, without writing your own retry logic, state management, or monitoring system.

We've built all the infrastructure needed to get you to production in an afternoon.

## FAQs

Common questions you'll likely have.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is butter different from other LLM chaining tools?">
    butter is a workflow engine, not a chaining library or dev tool. We focus on
    running, scaling, and managing LLM pipelines in production—durably, with
    full execution control, retries, and versioning.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I integrate butter?">
    You can integrate butter using code via our SDKs or using our REST APIs. The
    underlying engine handles orchestration and state regardless of which method
    you choose.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What kinds of workflows can I run with butter?">
    Any multi-step, LLM-powered flow: document parsing, RAG pipelines, data
    labeling, classification, summarization, enrichment, agent-like logic, and
    more.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are you SOC2 compliant?">
    Yes, we're SOC2 Type 2 compliant.
