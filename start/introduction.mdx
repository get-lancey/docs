butter lets you define multi-step AI workflows—like parsing, enrichment, and classification—and run them at scale, with built-in retries, versioning, and control.

## Key features

- **Handle retries and errors: **We automatically retry failed steps and handle errors gracefully
- **Manage references and dependencies:** Don't worry about writing code to manage which data references need to run first
- **Monitoring included**: Track your workflows and logs without additional setup
- **Fast and scalable: **Defer your backend logic to our fast and scalable platform

## What is durable execution?

Durable execution means your workflow can run reliably over time even if parts of it fail, restart, or get interrupted. Each step is tracked, retried if needed, and its state is saved so you don’t lose progress.

In practice, this means:

- If a step fails, it can automatically retry or fall back without restarting the whole workflow
- If your server restarts or crashes, the workflow picks up where it left off
- You can see exactly what ran, what succeeded, what failed, and why

This lets you run long-running, multi-step AI workflows (like document parsing or RAG) with confidence, without writing your own retry logic, state management, or monitoring system.

We've built all the infra needed to get you to production in an afternoon.
