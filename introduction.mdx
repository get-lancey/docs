## Lancey data hierarchy

Since we're dealing with tons of unstructured data, we first need a structure to make sense of it before we can put it to use.

-Here are some concepts to familiarize yourself with as you get started with Lancey.

<Note> Data flows in the order described below.</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Feedback">
    It all starts with raw feedback. Whether its **data coming from sales calls, support tickets, surveys,discussions or other sources**, it gets classified as feedback inside of Lancey. It can exist as either processed or unprocessed feedback.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Topics">
    Once a **feedback item is processed, Lancey's AI agents will pull out topics so you can easily make sense of the underlying data**. Topics can include things like feature requests, bugs, complaints, praises, promises and more.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Insights">
    As large amount of feedback data is processed through Lancey and topics are generated, we need to be able to see the forest through the trees. **Insight** is next order grouping of feedback topics. 
    
    **It combines data across all feedback sources in a way you can easily understand trends and themes** impacting your customers.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiatives">
    **Once you're ready to priorize an insight, you should create an initiative out of it so you can denote and track work being done by the product team**. 
    
    You can also instruct Lancey's AI agent Merlin to perform automated actions on your behalf such as generating product briefs, coming up with list of users to interview, or generating user stories based on the data.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Releases">
    Lastly, **releases represent a unit of work that makes its way into a user/customer's hand**. This is end-user facing work that you want to notify users of, whether its through a public roadmap, changelog, or notifications.

    Initatives can be turned into releases to make it easy to close feedback loops without manual work.
