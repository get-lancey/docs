### Understanding the Lancey hierarchy

Since we're dealing with tons of unstructured data, we first need a structure to make sense of it.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Feedback" href="/features/feedback/">
    It all starts with raw feedback. Whether its **data coming from sales calls, support tickets, surveys,discussions or other sources**, it gets classified as feedback inside of Lancey. It can exist as either processed or unprocessed feedback.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Topics">
    Once a **feedback item is processed, Lancey's AI agents will pull out topics so you can easily make sense of the underlying data**. Topics can include things like feature requests, bugs, complaints, praises, promises and more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insights">
    As large amount of feedback data is processed through Lancey and topics are generated, we need to be able to see the forest through the trees. **Insight** is next order grouping of feedback topics. It **brings data across all feedback sources into a way you can easily understand trends and themes** impacting your customers.
