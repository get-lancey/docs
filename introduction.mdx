## Lancey data hierarchy

Since we're dealing with tons of unstructured data, we first need a structure to make sense of it before we can put it to use.

Here are some concepts to familiarize yourself with as you get started with Lancey.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Feedback">
    It all starts with raw feedback. Whether its **data coming from sales calls, support tickets, surveys, discussions or other sources.**


  </Step>

  <Step title="Topics">
    Once a **feedback item is processed, Lancey's AI agents will pull out topics so you can easily make sense of the underlying data**. Topics can include things like feature requests, bugs, complaints, praises, promises and more.


  </Step>

  <Step title="Insights">
    As large amount of feedback data is processed through Lancey and topics are generated, we need to be able to see the forest through the trees. **Insight** is next order grouping of feedback topics.

    **It combines data across all feedback sources in a way you can easily understand trends and themes** impacting your customers.
