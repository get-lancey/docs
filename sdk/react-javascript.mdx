### Public key

You'll need your `Public key` which is found within project settings.

### Installation

You can install the Lancey SDK via several different options:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript npm
npm install @lancey-app/web

```

```javascript yarn
yarn add @lancey-app/web 

```

```javascript pnpm
pnpm add @lancey-app/web

```

</CodeGroup>

### React installation

```tsx
// npm install @lancey-app/web or or yarn add @lancey-app/web or pnpm add @lancey-app/web

  // In your app
import { LanceyProvider, useLancey } from '@lancey-app/web';
// or
const { loadLancey, useLancey } from "@lancey-app/web";

// Now go ahead and initialize LanceyProvider
const App = () => {
  return (
    <LanceyProvider
      apiKey={"YOUR PUBLIC KEY HERE"}  //note: do not use the secret key on frontend install
      options={{
        host: "https://api.demo.lancey.ai",
      }}
    >
    <MyComponent/>
  </LanceyProvider>
  );
}

// You can now use the Lancey React hook to access the Lancey SDK

const MyComponent = () => {
  const lancey = useLancey();

  lancey.identify("user_1234");

  return <div>My Component</div>;
}
```

### Identifying persons

Identifying persons is one of the first things you should do. This is usually done once your user(s) have logged in successfully. Having an identified person allows you to track events against them.

The following snippet shows how users can be identified.

```tsx

lancey.identify(
    'user_id', //replace 'user_id' with your users unique identifier
    { email: 'lance@lancey.com', name: 'Lance Lot' }, //set user properties
    extra?: {
      distinctCompanyId: 'company_id', //optional: replace 'company_id' with unique identifier for a company in your system
      companyProperties: {
        name: 'Knights Inc'
      }; //optional: set properties for companies
    }
  ):
```

### Identifying companies

Lancey has first class support for companies. This allows you to group different persons under one group for better attribution and tracking. For all B2B folks, you should make sure to connect persons to the company.

```tsx
lancey.identifyCompany(
	'company_id', //replace 'company_id' with unique identifier for a company in your system
  { name: 'Knights Inc' } //set company properties
);
```

### Tracking events

Tracking events allows you to gain an insight into what users are doing within your app. Events are using within Lancey to build powerful segments and workflows.

```tsx

lancey.track(
  'user clicked upgrade',
  { plan: 'Advanced' } // optional: set event properties to understand what took place
);
```

### Reset after logout

When a user logs out, you should call `reset` to unlink any future events made on that device with that user.

```tsx
lancey.reset();
```
