## Overview

Events are vital within Lancey's data model. They allow you to track activity that users perform within your product which can be used to segment and filter how you set up workflows and control who sees what (emails, in-app messages, etc...). 

All events need to have a name, a timestamp, and a user ID. You can also provide additional Events properties which describe the event in more detail.

### Event examples
A `Logged In` event might have a property called `Device`, which indicates whether the log in was on mobile or web.
A `Video Watched` event might have a property called `Video Id`, which tells you which video was watched.

### Tracking events

Before you can track events in Lancey, make sure you have the appropriate [Lancey SDK installed](/sdk).

<CodeGroup>


```tsx Node.js
// Tracking events on the backend requires you to pass in the `user_id` each time you make the track call.

lancey.track(
  'user_id', //replace 'user_id' with your users unique identifier
  'Plan Upgraded',
  { plan: 'Advanced' } // optional: set event properties to understand what happened for this specific event
);
```

```tsx React
lancey.track(
  'Plan Upgraded',
  { plan: 'Advanced' } // optional: set event properties to understand what happened for this specific event
);
```

</CodeGroup>

### Best Practices


#### 1. Maintain events in a general manner

Our suggestion is to keep event labels generic and employ properties to capture contextual details. For instance:

Rather than monitoring events labeled as `Video Viewed - Comedy` or `Video Viewed - Drama`, log a `Video Viewed` event while specifying a `Type` property as comedy or drama.


#### 2. Ensure consistent naming convention

We propose adopting a uniform naming convention for both your events and properties. 

For example:

Utilize camel case for your event names.
Follow the (Object) (Verb) structure for event names, such as `User Deleted` or `Plan Upgraded`.

#### 3. Steer clear of dynamically generated event names

For instance, refrain from generating an event name like `Trial Started (01-01-2023)`. Instead, establish an event named `Trial Started` and incorporate a property (e.g., trial expiry) set to the date 01-01-2023.
