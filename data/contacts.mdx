## Overview

People/Users/Persons/Contacts are used interchangeably and they denote a single unique person who is attached to a feedback item within Lancey.

Being such a core unit within Lancey, its important to understand how contacts get added to Lancey.

### Adding contacts

You can manually add contacts by heading to the [Contacts](https://app.lancey.ai/contacts/people/views/all) page.

### Syncing contacts

Whenever you automatically import a piece of feedback (sales call, support ticket, Github issue,etc...), Lancey will generate a contact to associate with that item. If a contact already exists, it will use that instead.
