## Overview

Companies/Accounts are used interchangeably and they denote a single unique Company who is attached to the [Contacts](/data/contacts) within Lancey.

Being such a core unit within Lancey, its important to understand how companies get added to Lancey.

### Adding Companies

You can manually add company by heading to the [Company](https://app.lancey.ai/contacts/companies/views/all) page.

### Syncing Companies

Whenever you automatically import a piece of feedback (sales call, support ticket, Github issue,etc...), Lancey will generate a company based on the domain of the contact's email to associate with that item. If a company already exists, it will use that instead.
